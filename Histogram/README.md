# Parallel Histogram
The code was parallelized using Pthreads. Pthreads requires the serial code variables to become global. In order to calculate the histogram using many threads each thread needs to know their working scope so that information do not get mixed up. In this manner, it must be created two variables that indicate the first and last elements of the scope. To do this calculation it is also necessary to determine the number os bins for each thread.

For a smaller workload the use of an increasing number of threads might not be as profitable as expected once the creation and destruction of threads can generate overhead and cause a delay compared to the serial version of the code. Although this occurs, using different thread quantity can be beneficial applied to bigger workloads. The process of thread  manipulation can still be profitable because it will help to reduce time in the parallel code and not increase it compared to small data.
